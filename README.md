# hello-world
Hello. My name is Neal Schwarz. I'm excited to start on a new journey in web development. Previously, I attended Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. I recieved a Bachelor's Degree in Georgraphy with a minor in Historical Studies. During my time there my medical condition began to become severe in 2017-2018. I eventually had to stop working and attending school. I had nine credits left to graduate. In 2019, I had life-saving major surgery. I took a full year off to let my body heal. Two years later I returned to SIUE to finish my degree. Since that time it has been hard to find work in geographic jobfield. I missed a lot of time due to my illness. Currently, I'm on disability and trying to rejoin the workforce. I think web development will be an exciting and eduacating experience.
